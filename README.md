# License_Plate_and_Face_Recognition

## Description
License Plate and Face Recognition is a safety program that was incorporated in our Smart Parking System. It works on two cameras, one for detecting and recognising faces and second to read the number plate of the person. Later this information can be extracted to a json file or any database.

## Requirements
OpenCV
Pytesseract ocr
face_recognition library
Python

## Why "what" is required
Using opencv , harrcascade to detect license plate and pytesseract to capture the read the license plate. Furthermore, Using opencv and face_recognition library to detect and recognises faces using a single image..


## Future Enhancements
1. Faster technique to recognise number plate.
2. Able to work on less powered machines like Rasperry Pi.
3. Independent functions not based on library.

### Working of project has not been shown because of privacy issues.
